# Project 3: Mindscape Fest
By Jing Ling

# Project overview 
This website is about a Mental Health Awareness Festival. I chose to represent this cause because I struggled with my mental health for a long time without having the resources I wish I had today. My audiences are mainly teens and young adults. I think this topic is important to address because young people should know that they are not alone in their struggles and that there are resources to help them. Mental health can be a hard topic to discuss but by bringing awareness to it through events like this festival, it provides a safe space for individuals to talk about their experiences and seek help if needed. Furthermore, I think addressing mental health early can prevent future problems and promote overall well-being. 

The opening event is on a Friday which consist of musical performances by Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato. I specifically chose these artists to perform because they have talked about their mental health publicly and spread awareness. The following events are self-care activities such as guided meditation, yoga, nails, walks around the Golden Gate Park. The closing event is a Nickelodeon Q&A. It involves Nickelodeon stars talking about their experiences in the industry and how it impacted their mental health. Tote bages containing items such as CBD lotion, chocolates, hand massage, stress ball, and bath bombs will be on sale.
