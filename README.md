# Project 3: Mindscape Fest
By Jing Ling

# Project overview 
Welcome to the Mindscape Fest! Our primary goal is to create a safe and inclusive space where individuals can openly discuss their mental health struggles, access resources, and seek support if needed. By raising awareness and breaking down stigmas, we hope to empower young people to prioritize their mental well-being and seek help when necessary. The target audiences are teens and young adults who may be struggling with their mental health or seeking more information and support. We aim to reach out to individuals who may feel isolated or misunderstood in their experiences, providing them with a supportive community and valuable resources. This festival is more than just an event. It's a movement towards destigmatizing mental health and creating a culture of openness and support. We invite you to join us in this journey as we strive to make a difference.

The opening event is on a Friday consisting of musical performances by Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato. These artists are chosen to perform because they have talked about their mental health publicly and spread awareness. The following events are self-care activities such as guided meditation, yoga, nails, and walks around the Golden Gate Park. The closing event is a Nickelodeon Q&A. It involves Nickelodeon stars talking about their experiences in the industry and how it impacted their mental health. There are also tote bages containing items such as CBD lotion, chocolates, hand massage, stress ball, and bath bombs on sale.
