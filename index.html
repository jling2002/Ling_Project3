<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<h3>We are a group of people working together to bring attention to the topic of mental health, which is often ignored or looked down upon.</h3>

		<!-- <h3>Every year, millions of Americans suffer from mental illness. It is important to know how many people have mental illness so we can understand how it affects their bodies, relationships, and money. Furthermore, it serves as a reminder that people are not struggling alone.</h3>
